# Hello, Cloud: Terraform tutorial at OSCON 2017

## Overview

These are the files we are using for our Terraform tutorial. While the class is meant to walk people through creating the resources on their own, these file are here for later reference or to help people catch up if they fall behind during the workshop.

When we have video, we'll post it.

## Requirements

To use this tutorial you need the following:

- An active AWS account. When creating the AWS provider resource you will need to provide your own keys.

- The terraform binary. If you do not already have a local copy you can get it here: https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html

For Mac folks who use brew you can also use `brew install terraform`

- A text editor of your choice.
